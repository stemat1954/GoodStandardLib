	A tally is a counting indicator.

	Note: See alpha\indicator for more info.

	:begin sets min, max, and initial values. It also
	sets default wait time and execution mode.

	A tally is "directional".  Generally, it starts at one
	end of the range and moves to the other. Initial level 
	should be min or max.  A tally that starts at the min 
	level indicates at the max level.  Conversely, a tally
	that starts at the max level inicates at the min level.

	Note:  Initial level not equal to min or max is an 
	invalid	configuration that causes disruption.

	A tally can be used to regulate how often a thread
	reponds to asynchronous events.  One side increases or
	decreases the tally, while another side waits for the
	limit to be reached.  When a waiting thread is released
	by an indicated tally, it responds and resets the tally.

	The default wait time is used when :wait is called with
	a null elapsed time.  If the default wait time is also 
	null, :wait does not time-out.

	The tally execution mode is auto-reset if input auto
	is 'true' or null. Otherwise, execution mode is manual-
	reset.

	:inc increases the tally by one up to the max level.

	:dec decreases the tally by one down to the min level.
	
	base :reset sets the tally back to it's initial value
	and clears the release state.
