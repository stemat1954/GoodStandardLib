type monitor 
{{
	A monitor is a configurable indicator panel.
 		
	Individual indicators are added to a monitor in priority
	order.  Each indicator has an application assigned id. 
	Indicators are bound to the monitor using an internal 
	handle, so they must remain in scope while joined to 
	the monitor.
		
	:wait returns when any indicator is in a release state,
	subject to a given time limit.  If more than one 
	indicator is in a release state, the highest priority
	indicator releases the wait.  An output identifies 
	which indicator released the wait.  If time expires,
	the output is null. If no time limit is given, :wait
	does not expire.
		
	Note: Any side effect of waiting on an individual
	indicator will be reproduced if, and only if, a
	indicator is identified.  In particular, a indicator's
	release state is reset only if it is identified.
