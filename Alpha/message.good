type message 
{{
	A message is an external data structure.

	A message encapsulates heap memory and provides
	methods for formatting and parsing arbitrary external
	data.  Messages are used to communicate with external
	entities.

	Many Alpha types support precise external data formats.
	Types that support external formats are "portable."
	
	:fread and :fwrite are generic methods that call object
	methods to do the actual reading and writing.  :fread
	copies data from message to object, while :fwrite copies
	data from object to message. 
	
	Reading an object is object initialization, so :fread
	calls object :begin.  Writing an object	only requires
	[eval] permission, and :fwrite calls object :fwrite
		
	Object message methods are given a [upd] input message
	and an input expr that describes a particular external 
	format (fex). Some types (especially managed object 
	types) may require extra format exprs.  Supported 
	formats and the exprs that describe them are type
	dependent. Alpha formats are documented in the Alpha
	Type Reference.

	Note:  A particular type may support numerous external
	formats and versions of those formats.	Format exprs
	may simply enumerate the literal possibilities or they
	may have syntactic forms that require interpretation.

	Application types can define message methods that 
	follow the same standard interface.  In principle, any
	application object can be formatted as some sequence of
	individually rendered sub-objects that are ultimately
	rendered by Alpha message methods. 
		
	Applications can write their own methods but in most 
	cases it's easier to simply define an image as part of
	the type definition and let the compiler write both 
	methods automatically. An image defines	a composition 
	of sub-objects and their formats.  Each image is 
	associated with a format label.  A type can have 
	multiple images and the compiler will write methods
	that select the correct one from a given fex.
	
	If an application chooses to write custom message
	methods, it can usually do so by simply reading and
	writing sub-objects in a straight forward serial_access
	fashion.  However, more advanced applications may need
	to format data in a random access fashion, which 
	requires knowing the precise size of formatted data,
	moving the position cursors, keeping track of unfor-
	matted regions, and generally managing the overall size.
		
	Note: An application can format virtually any well-
	defined data buffer using provided methods.  However, 
	using the advanced methods requires a thorough under-
	standing of usage to avoid creating a corrupt and
	totally useless message.  So, programmer beware!

	A message has two modal formatting options that 
	supplement individual format specs:  endianess and
	UTF (Unicode Transformational Format). Modal format
	options are specified when a message is initialized.

	Note:  Default modal format is controlled by two common
	settings. Initial defaults are set at startup to plat-
	form dependent values (common constants), but they can
	be reset at any time by calling set_default_message_
	format, or by direct reinitialization.
		
	Endianess controls byte order.  For example, if an 
	int fex specifies an 8 byte, twos-complement binary 
	value, and a message is initialized with 
	'little-endian', the 8 int bytes are serially written
	least-significant to most-significant in the message.  
	Conversly,  if the message is initialized with 
	'big-endian', the 8 bytes are serially written most-
	significant to least-significant in the message.

	UTF encoding controls text encoding.  If an object
	is stored in-message using any unicode text format, 
	UTF encoding controls how the code point values are 
	stored. UTF encoding does not apply to binary formats.
	If 'UTF-16' or 'UTF-32' is used, endianess controls
	byte order. 
		
	Note: A message may contain an arbitrary mix of 
	objects stored using binary and unicode formats. A	
	message that only contains objects stored as unicode
	is a special case text message.  stock\text derives
	from message and has methods that are specialized
	for text handling.
	
	
	A message maintains a block of heap memory to contain
	data.  Message data is naturally intended for external 
	consumption, so at some point the memory must be 
	detached and given to some primitive subroutine (e.g.
	kernel subroutine) for final disposition.  
	
	Detaching message memory creates an unattached message
	and an orphan memory block that must be reattached to
	some message or freed by some other	procedure. 
	Detaching memory does not affect the read/write position
	cursors.

	External heap memory can be attached (or reattached)
	to an unattached message.  The memory usually originates 
	from another message or from a primitive procedure.
	The memory block may or may not contain	formatted data.
	Once external memory is attached to a message, the message
	owns the memory and applications must not allow the given
	addr to be used in any way.
	
	When an application uses advanced methods to construct 
	a message, it generally needs to manipulate	size and
	two position cursors rp (read position or pointer) and
	wp (write position or pointer).
	
	Size measures the logical extent of	formatted data
	in bytes, rp defines the current (next) read position
	in bytes, and wp defines the current (next) write
	position in bytes.  Various methods directly set
	these values, while object methods automatically update
	these values.

	Note: size measures the logical extent of formatted 
	data.  The actual block size may be greater	than the
	logical size. 
	
	Initially, size, wp, and rp are zero.  When size is 
	zero, the heap memory addr is null. 
	
	wp and rp are constrained such that
	
		0 <= rp,wp <= size 
	
	at all times. rp and wp equal to size is a limit 
	aka "end" position.
					
	Any attempt to read a message beyond the last character
	will disrupt the app.  rp can be placed automatically 
	or specifically to the end position, but this is not a 
	valid read position.
	
	Writing objects automatically moves wp and automaticaly
	increases size if wp exceeds size.  If wp is set beyond
	the end, size is automatically increased.  Thus, it's 
	not possible to disrupt the app by writing past	the end. 
	However, "randomly" setting wp beyond the end creates an
	unformatted "hole" in the data, so random access app-
	lications must carefully track the location of formatted
	data and holes.

	Methods that increase size do not change wp or rp, but
	if size is decreased, wp and rp may be adjusted	to their
	limit positions to keep them in range.
	
	Detaching memory does not change wp or rp.
	
	Attaching memory may adjust wp and rp to their limit
	positions to keep them in range. If a logical size is
	not specified when mem is attached, the heap block size
	is used by default. If a logical size IS specified, it's
	verified (less or equal to block size).

	Note: If preformatted memory is attached without a 
	logical size spec, the heap block size is generally more
	than the logical size, so applications must immediately
	locate the logical end of formatted data and set logical 
	size.  This is a common scenario for example, when
	primitive subroutines return null-terminated strings
	with no size information.

	:set_rp_mod and :set_wp_mod align their respective pos-
	itions on a	specified modulo boundary, if they aren't 
	already aligned.  rp will not be moved beyond end, but 
	wp will be properly placed, and size will be increased 
	as necessary.
	
	
				
	Intra-message :move shifts a q-byte block by n bytes, 
	where n is signed: 

		(1) block read q bytes from rp 
		(2) set rp,wp = rp + n
		(3) block write q bytes from wp

	Thus, rp is at the start of the shifted block, and wp
	is positioned on the next byte after the shifted block.
	If the block is shifted up (positive) beyond size, 
	size will be increased and wp will be at the end. Other-
	wise, size is not changed. Shifting memory generally
	leaves holes in the message, so the application must
	adjust size (truncate) and/or fill holes as needed.
	 
	Inter-message :copy copies a q-byte block from a 
	source message without changing source rp.  Thus, the
	given source message is constant:
	
	(1) block read up to q bytes from source using given
		rp or source rp
	(2) set q2 = actual bytes read
	(3) set it rp = it wp
	(4) block write q2 bytes from it wp

	If rp *is* specified, it overrides the source message 
	rp.  If q is not specified (null), all data is copied 
	from the source starting at the effective rp.  When the
	method returns, (this) rp is at the start of copied 
	data and (this) wp is at the end. Size is increased (or
	not) as neccessary. Copying	memory may leave holes in
	the message, so the	application must adjust size 
	(truncate) and/or fill holes as necessary.


	:enable_auto_align turns on alignment for binary
	formats.  Objects will be written and read on platform
	compatible memory boundaries.  

	
	A message has an internal level value used for evident
	images.  An evident image is a text format that has 
	labeled and indented sub-objects similar to JSON.  Level
	is used to maintain the format nesting level, which in
	turn can be used to calculate the indention	of sub-
	objects. Initial level is zero.

	:inc_level and :dec_level adjust the level by one, plus
	and minus respectively.  :get_level returns the current
	level in an output.

	:write_new_line writes a string of ascii control
	characters plus an optional expresion:
	
		'CR' + 'LF' + ( level * 'TAB' )
		+ expr + 'SP' + '=' + 'SP'	 -- optional
