type enumerated  -- intrinsic
{{
	enumerated is a base type for countable subtypes.

	An enumerated object is associated with a unique
	identical integer value.  The value must be greater
	than or equal to zero, and it must uniquely identify
	one, and only one, object in a set of the same 
	enumerated type.

	Note:  Best practice is to assign ints contiguously
	from zero.

	Note:  Technically, enumerated is a complete type, but
	there's no point in instantiating an object	with an 
	actual type of enumerated.

	An enumerated object's int value can be used to 
	efficiently compare and sort objects in lieu of type-
	specific methods.  Applications convert the	object to
	int using method :as_int and then use int methods to 
	evaluate objects for equivalance and relative order.  

	Some enumerated types may define arithmetic and other 
	int relationships between objects.  
		
	Pragma enum type definitions are translated into general
	enumerated subtypes.  Alpha type ascii is also an enum-
	erated subtype.  
	
	Application can define other enumerated subtypes.
