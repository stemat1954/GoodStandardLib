type trace -- instrisic,restricted
{{	
	A trace is a source code locator.

	Type trace is restricted.  It can't be subtyped
	or used in another type instance. 

	Trace objects are created by the compiler when an
	application quits.  If an application specifies an 
	object type in the quit	expression, the HGM creates
	the specified object and attaches it to the trace
	object along with the location info.

	Note: See alpha\fault for example of quit object type.

	:location accesses an internal formatted expr that 
	includes book name, page name, page file name, and 
	line number.

	The compiler pushes a trace to an internal disruption
	object which can be accessed in any trap block.  See
	alpha\disruption.
